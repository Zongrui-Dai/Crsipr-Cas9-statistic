# NGG-NGN-statistic
## NGG
Biopython extracts the frequency of 'NGG' in genome. Due to the existence of scaffold sequence, the frequency of each scaffold will be computed. 19 choromsomes, which has different amounts of 'NGG'can be calculated, while the ratio of 'NGG'/length can be almost the same(~0.02)

## NGN
The same as NGN. Biopython calculate the frequency while R points the figure. The 'NGN'/length can be almost the same in each chromosome(~0.1)
